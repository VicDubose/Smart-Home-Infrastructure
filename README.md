# Smart Home Infrastructure & Automation Lab

![System Architecture](diagrams/home_system_overview.png)

A portfolio repository documenting the architecture and automation systems used in my residential smart home lab.

This project integrates **Home Assistant, network engineering, virtualization, automation, and energy management** to create a fully automated residential infrastructure platform.

The system demonstrates real-world applications of:

- Infrastructure automation
- IoT system integration
- Energy optimization
- Network engineering
- DevOps-style configuration management

---

## System Goals

The project was designed to demonstrate practical infrastructure engineering through a real residential deployment environment.

Primary goals include:

- Reliable smart home automation architecture
- Energy optimization and load management
- Resilient system backup and disaster recovery
- Integration of multiple IoT ecosystems
- Modular automation development using version-controlled configuration

---

## Project Scope

The system manages a live residential automation environment including:

- Multi-zone HVAC automation
- Energy optimization using solar and battery storage
- EV charging coordination
- Security camera integration
- Appliance scheduling based on energy pricing
- Network infrastructure supporting automation servers and IoT devices
